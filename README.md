Stellar Learn is a **free, open-source gamified platform** that takes anyone from "what is blockchain?" to building real applications on the Stellar network — through a playable 2D pixel-art adventure game.

## The Concept

Navigate 6 themed worlds, each teaching a new layer of the Stellar ecosystem. Complete quests (lessons, quizzes, coding challenges). Battle bosses by proving your knowledge. Interact with the **real Stellar testnet** — create accounts, send XLM, issue assets, deploy smart contracts — all inside the game.

| World | Theme | Topic |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Origin Plains | 🌲 Forest | Blockchain fundamentals, Stellar, XLM |
| 2. Wallet Kingdom | 🏰 Castle | Accounts, keypairs, balances |
| 3. Asset Forge | ⚒️ Dungeon | Issuing assets, trustlines |
| 4. Trading Bazaar | ⛰️ Mountain | SDEX, swaps, liquidity pools |
| 5. Payment Realm | 💫 Castle Dungeon | Transactions, cross-border payments |
| 6. Soroban Citadel | 🏯 Final Boss | Smart contracts with Soroban |

## Roadmap

- [ ] World 1: Origin Plains (complete)
- [ ] World 2: Wallet Kingdom
- [ ] World 3: Asset Forge
- [ ] World 4: Trading Bazaar
- [ ] World 5: Payment Realm
- [ ] World 6: Soroban Citadel
- [ ] Leaderboard
- [ ] NFT achievement certificates (minted on Stellar)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive game view
- [ ] Storybook component library
- [ ] i18n (multi-language support)
- [ ] **Study Groups** — players form small groups for cooperative study:
      shared progress, group quests/challenges, and a private group leaderboard.

### Planned: Study Groups

A social layer where a player can create or join a **study group** (think a guild
or party). Planned scope:

- Create a group with an invite code / link; members join and see each other.
- A **group dashboard** showing each member's world progress and combined XP.
- **Group challenges** — quests that unlock once enough members complete them,
  encouraging members to help one another.
- A **private group leaderboard** alongside the global one (Upstash Redis sorted
  sets, same pattern as the existing leaderboard).
- Optional **co-op boss battles** where group members' combined quiz scores power
  the fight.

This is a future feature — tracked here so contributors can design data models
(extend `packages/database/`) and APIs around it early. See also
[`ASSETS.md`](ASSETS.md) for the art a group UI would need (member avatars,
group badges).
